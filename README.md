# YouTube & TikTok Trends Insights（2025）
# Project Background
（Backround about the company, including the industry, active years, business model, and key business metrics. Explain this from the POV of a data analyst who is working at the company.）
Short-form video platforms—especially TikTok and YouTube Shorts—have become critical acquisition channels for brands and digital-first products. They shape awareness, engagement, and conversion intent for billions of users globally.

Yet content investment decisions on these platforms often rely on copycat creative practices instead of data-driven strategy. This results in:

- Suboptimal platform allocation
- Inefficient content production and creative spending
- Underutilized high-growth audience segments
- Poor timing and low viral breakout potential

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Platform Comparisons**: Comparison of discovery power and engagement behaviors across TikTok and YouTube Shorts.
- **Content Format Performance**: Evaluation of duration, hook style, pacing, and audio elements to identify outperforming formats.
- **Category & Regional Patterns**: Identification of growth segments where demand outpaces content supply.
- **Seasonality & Timing Patterns**: Insights into when content gains higher-than-usual discovery and engagement lift.

> Objective: Deliver data-backed insights and actionable recommendations to support content investment decisions across TikTok and YouTube Shorts.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
